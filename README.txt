Graphic simulation of the basic rules of Frogger in Python. This program uses the
graphics.py library to recreate the basic rules and layout of Frogger.

This program also utilizes a modified projectile.py. The original
projectile.py and graphics.py were written by John Zelle for Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science (3rd Ed.). The cannonball simulation program
"animation2.py" was used as a reference on how to make multiple graphics.py objects
move simultaneously.
