Text simulation of the basic rules of Frogger in Python. This text based version promts the
user for a direction for the frog to take it's next jump to. The coordinates of all the
moving vehicles and the frog are printed each round. Once the frog crosses the street 
(Y value = 3 approx.) or gets hit by one of the vehicles, the game ends.

This program utilizes textProjectile.py, a modified projectile.py. The original
projectile.py was written by John Zelle for Python Programming: An Introduction 
to Computer Science (3rd Ed.). The "Dice Poker" case study from Chapter 12 was also
used as a reference.
